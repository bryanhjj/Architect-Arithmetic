# Architect-Arithmetic
A small project from codecademy

Architects have big ideas, but big ideas can be expensive. How expensive? Depends on the size.

In this project, you'll use methods to build a program that calculates the material cost for any architect's floor plan.
(these floor plans are uploaded as arith_ref, arith_challenge_1, and arith_challenge_2)
